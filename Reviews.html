            <p>I still can't believe One Piece has hit this milestone. It's one of the very few to make it this far. The cover is perfect celebrating currently what's going on in Wano while mixing in elements of the past.

              It's rather fitting that volume 100 centers on the clash between two Emperors and the best of Worst Generation. It feels like a turning point in One Piece. After a hundred volumes the crew is ready to shake the very foundation of their world. It is truly something epic to behold.
              
              I have reading One Piece since 2004 and from the bottom of my heart I want to say. Congrats Oda for hitting this milestone. And thank you so much for sharing such an amazing story with the world. -MickManga</p>
